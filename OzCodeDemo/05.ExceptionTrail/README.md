# Exception Trail
**Effortlessly understand the root cause of a bug by instantly navigating to the *inner-most* InnerException, and drill into the exception's callstack and associated data.**
## Overview
Without OzCode, investigating an exception is a dreary task -  navigating through a trail of inner exceptions, scrolling through lengthy callstacks, and squinting through the exceptionâ€™s associated data to try to make sense of the error. With OzCode, all the relevant information about the exception is presented in a handy tool-window. You can navigate through each inner-exception with a super- convenient breadcrumb control, and even launch a Google or StackOverflow search right from within Visual Studio!
## Using Exception Trail
In order to run this demo click the _Exception Trail_ button in the demo application.  
**Note: For this demo make sure that _break on exceptions_ is turned off**

It may take a few tries, but after a while you should break after an exception was caught:

Open the exception trail by selecting  _View exception details_ from the bar or from the _quick actions_ menu (on the side).

![Exception details](Resources/exceptionDetails.PNG)

We can see the exception details summary - there are three inner exceptions and the first exception thrown was an _IllegalOrderException_.
From here we can navigate the inner exceptions easily, as well as search for additional information about the exception type or message through one of the supported providers:

Another time-saving feature is the ability to go to where the exception was thrown - quickly finding the root cause of the problem. You can do so either from the _Excpetion details dialog_ or from the exception bar.

You will arrive at the exception origin without needing to traverse the exception and its inner exceptions.
